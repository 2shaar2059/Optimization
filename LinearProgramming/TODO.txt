        aux problem infeasible?

pivoting rule?

Detecting unbounded feasible region

detect stopping

detect cycles

degenerate pivots (basic variable = 0)

Test cases for each of the above

Dont add artificial varialebs for equailty cosntraints born out of inequality because slack variable can double as artificial variable
